Ok, this is the first version of a protracker / noisetracker .mod to midi .mid converter.
Currently it is very basic and not working very well with each .mod file, it is in work-in-progress state
because not each sample in a mod file have a correct name. the script is trying to understand what instruments are choosen by reading the names,
if no matching name was found it will try to use different midi instruments or piano, its just my first test
but you can already test it with some amiga protracker .mod files for example from AmiNet.
